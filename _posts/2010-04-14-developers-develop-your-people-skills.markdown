title: Developers, Develop Your People Skills
---
Whether you’re a one-person consulting company or a startup attempting to build and sell a commercial product, sooner or later you have to find someone willing to pay you.  To do that successfully, you have to hone your people skills.  And while many tech entrepreneurs are excellent at writing code or fixing technical issues, we may find it difficult to exercise the same level of ability in selling our products or services. ...To say the least.

<img title="Developers Also Need to Develop People Skills" src="http://developers.outright.com/files/2010/04/1164982_happy_family_.jpg" alt="Developers Also Need to Develop People Skills" hspace="10" width="300" height="225" align="right" />I speak from long experience.  It’s taken me several years to become an effective communicator, and even after long practice, my people skills can only be termed average.  I still don’t do a great job promoting myself in situations where I could do my business the most good.

I’m sorry to say that there’s no easy way around this obstacle.  Even with e-mail, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/charts-of-the-week-facebook-is-absolutely-crushing-the-competition-2010-4">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.urbanmusewriter.com/2010/04/freelance-writers-guide-to-linkedin.html">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2010/04/what-can-startups-learn-from-l.php">Twitter</a>, there remains a critical need to project both confidence and friendliness in group and interpersonal encounters.  You have to build the professional and personal relationships that will probably always be necessary to create a successful image.  And a lot of that has to be done in person.

If your company has the resources, you can hire marketing or sales talent, but sooner or later your customers will want to talk to the person leading the effort.  Besides, you’ll have to grow quite a big company before you can delegate that role to others.  In the end, the burden to be the face of your company is yours.

I know some tech people, such as the professional technical trainers and consultants, who are quite good at the people part of their business.  In many cases, they’ve sought and received professional coaching.  If your soft skills aren’t good, you should consider a similar investment.  A big part of running a successful company of any size is to be both the chief sales person and chief diplomat.  Without those skills, business that you should win could easily be lost.

Before you decide to engage a professional coach or other type of training, examine your own abilities and personality carefully and objectively.  Because it’s difficult to be completely objective about yourself, also ask those around you that you trust, and take their advice.

But you can also take some of the <a href="http://www.similarminds.com/">personality tests</a>, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator">Meyer-Briggs</a>, to determine your strengths and weaknesses.  Once you have a good idea of your personality type, it may pay to have that confirmed by a professional personality psychologist.

Of course, you may already know that your people skills can use some work; I knew, without anyone having to tell me.  So I worked on it.  I became a college teacher, and practiced public speaking on a regular basis, to learn to feel comfortable in front of an audience.

Further, I learned to watch and listen in social situations.  I looked for behaviors and responses in others that looked as though they were favorably received, and practiced them.  And I purposely put myself in a greater array of social situations than I had known before – conferences, charity events, parties, and similar activities.

Much of what I did was outside of my comfort zone.  If you’re going to make your company a success, you have to do things outside your comfort zone, too.  The more you are able to experience while being able to be comfortable socializing, talking business, and promoting your company, the better known your company will be, too.
