title: 3 Warning Signs of a Nightmare Client
---
Sales calls. We've all fielded and initiated them. Some are great, some are strange, some are disappointing. They are all an adventure.

If you talk to most developers, sales is probably the least favorite part of running a business. But sales is also the lifeblood of any developer's business. Without new clients we don't get paid and have to go back to working for the man. Yuck.

<img title="3 Warning Signs of a Nightmare Client" src="http://developers.outright.com/files/2010/05/103170_dream_staircase.jpg" alt="3 Warning Signs of a Nightmare Client" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" height="300" align="right" />Over the last 6+ years of speaking with potential clients (luckily I am past the days of having to cold call people), I've gotten a lot smarter about being able to tell the difference between the <a href="http://bookendslitagency.blogspot.com/2010/05/dream-client.html">dream clients</a> (people who are well-financed, fun to work with and value your contribution to their business) and the nightmares. And by nightmare I mean clients that will literally give you either insomnia or bad dreams when you do finally fall asleep.

Usually within the first couple of minutes a potential client will tip their hand to whether they're going to be a great source of recurring revenue through continued use of your services (i.e. a dream client) or a sharp pain in your side.

Here are some of the things potential clients say that raise a red flag:

<strong>"I'll give you equity."</strong>

Translation: "I want a freebie."
Anytime you hear this from a potential client, either walk away or hang up the phone as fast as you can. You will have <a href="http://yogandmeditation.com/natural-migraine-cure-change-your-eating-habits/">averted a migraine</a>.

I heard this line a lot when I first started my web development company in 2004. Unfortunately, in my experience it seems to be making a comeback. I blame the unemployment rate and near zero barrier to entry for online startups. Everyone is dipping their toes into the entrepreneurial waters.

Here's why this is so dangerous for your business: first, let's talk financial. Unless you are super rich and are <a href="http://anthillonline.com/if-running-your-business-isn%E2%80%99t-fun-you-must-be-doing-it-wrong/">running a development company for fun</a>, you<em> </em>probably need to get paid for your time. This is the exact opposite. Your work like a maniac and get nothing but a piece of paper that says you own 25% of a company that makes no money. Resist the urge to be a part of the next big thing and stick to jobs that pay the bills.

Next, <em>everyone </em>believes their idea is the next big thing. That's great. I don't have any problem with passion. What I do caution you to be aware of is a potential client who is inexperienced, ignorant, or operating under blind faith. So many wannabe-entreprenuers I talk to haven't thought through their ideas in enough detail yet. They don't have a business plan, yet they are convinced that their new idea will make them rich in 2 years or less when they sell it to Google. They also don't want to take the time to do any due diligence. They just want to find someone to develop their idea and figure out things like how to make money later. Unless they are the luckiest person in the world, that idea is probably destined to fail.

<strong>"I want to build the next eBay/Craigslist/Facebook, MySpace, only better."</strong>

Translation: "I don't have a clue how much work is involved to build what I want to build."

I've actually heard all of the above examples before. The funny part is that none of these potential clients had any requirements documents, scopes of work, or even something drawn on the <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2010/05/start-drawing-your-ideas/">back of a napkin</a>. In other words, they perceived the project to be simple...and to them that means inexpensive. That points to unrealistic expectations.

Here's why this is so dangerous for your business: the rags-to-riches success stories of college dropouts turning into cagillionaires get a lot of press, but they are few and far between. After all, there's only one Google. The overwhelming majority of companies fail, and fail quickly. So the odds are against all business owners. If a potential client can't grasp this basic fact of business and already assumes they are going to compete with <a href="http://gettingstarted.outright.com/home-business/ebay-selling/">eBay</a> right from the start, then they are out of touch.

<em>Side note: If someone says they want to build the next Craigslist, then they better be prepared to pay for it! Remember, those are all extremely well-financed companies. If they weren't started by someone with money, at least they got a loan to get started. Building something for $1,000 or $5,000 in this case just to get started isn't really a competitor. It's a joke.</em>

Next, I don't care how great of a development team you have, this kind of client tends to have an unquenchable thirst for satisfaction. No matter how hard or smart you work, it will never be enough. You'll end up hating the project as a result. You don't want that. You are much better off passing on the project and wishing the person good luck.

<strong>"Looking for someone local."</strong>

Translation: "I'm looking to hire someone located close enough for me to stalk...and I don't really understand the Internet."

This is another fairly common one. It has to do with the client's lack of trust. It has nothing to do with you, obviously, but this person or company is so controlling that they want everything done right under their nose. That can take the form of working on-location or having frequent in-person meetings to go over progress. Those are both scenarios you need to avoid.

Here's why this is so dangerous for your business: first, the client is telling you that they are super high-maintenance. To me, that means that you can work your rear end off, but it still won't make them happy. Also, in-person meetings are generally a waste of time - especially for something like development or a website. You can easily keep your customer apprised of progress via phone with screenshot technology.

The second reason this is dangerous is that this potential client doesn't fully understand one of the great things about the Internet - you don't have to be next door to produce quality work. This is a huge warning sign to me because it tells me a couple of things: the first is that you are probably going to have to spend an inordinate amount of time justifying your advice because the client just doesn't understand all of the unique aspects of successful web development and marketing. Second, there's that trust reason again. They feel that people that are located in their region is better and that someone a phone call away can't possible be a legitimate provider.

One last thought to remember - at the end of the day you need to find the right clients for  your business. You can't just take on any new business that agrees to  pay you for your services. I hope these tips help you become better at weeding out the nightmares and having more dream clients.
