title: The Challenges of Funding a Software Startup
---
Starting a company whose primary asset is <a href="http://icreporting.blogspot.com/2010/04/intellectual-capital-whats-in-it-for-me.html">intellectual capital</a> is a different beast than most of the startup efforts you see.  Whether you buy a franchise or start a retail store, you have to put up a significant amount of money to buy franchise rights, rent and renovate space, and stock <a href="http://stores.outright.com/answers/is-there-a-place-for-inventory-tracking-724">inventory</a> for sale.

In contrast, many software startups don’t require much in the way of physical space, and typically don’t have an inventory.  I know of one modestly successful commercial software company that has been in existence for over six years, and is still run out of its founder’s basement (though he is currently looking for commercial office space).

Unlike many small business startups, banks are almost certainly not the place to turn for startup loans.  Unlike more traditional small businesses, you have no inventory or physical infrastructure that can be put up as collateral for a loan.

A few entrepreneurs take out mortgages on their home to finance their business, but the ability to “bet the ranch” takes a certain kind of confidence that few of us possess (I know I don’t).

Most of the successful software entrepreneurs I know have bootstrapped their companies, either living off savings or continuing to work at least part time to pay the bills.  This is usually a significant sacrifice in time, but if the company is successful, the rewards can be huge.  And at the very least you don’t have to answer to financial backers or an independent board of directors.

Outside money is available, but you need a combination of name recognition, connections, and a rock-solid business plan.  There are a couple of possibilities here.  The first is <a href="http://investorjunkie.com/angel-investors-a-blessing-for-start-up-entrepreneurs?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=angel-investors-a-blessing-for-start-up-entrepreneurs">angel investors</a>, who are wealthy individuals with the resources and inclination to take a chance on someone starting a company.  Angels typically get in on the ground floor, put up some seed money (typically less than $100,000) and own rights to a significant portion of the company if it’s successful.  You find angel investors primarily through personal connections; they don’t advertise, and they often look just as much at the character and work ethic of the individual as they do the business plan.  It can be as much a personal as a business relationship.

The second is <a href="http://freelance.outright.com/resources/3f%E2%80%99s-angel-investors-and-venture-capitalist/">venture capitalists</a>, or VCs.  VCs are professional investors who are in it primarily for the money.  They want to build a company quickly, and either take it public or have it acquired in order to pay back their investment.  Despite the exposure VC-funded tech startups receive in the press and popular literature, they are few and have a difficult and demanding road.

The difficulty of obtaining financial backing is why many software entrepreneurs choose a hybrid business model – they provide consulting services at the same time they develop a product.  The consulting services pay the day-to-day expenses, and finance the resources necessary to build a software product over the course of months or years.  It will take longer to build a product, but you can have a reasonable cash flow during the process.

However you might choose to fund your business, recognize that there are tradeoffs in achieving your goal.  Whatever path you take will require greater effort or sacrifice, loss of control, or giving up part of the company.  And there are no guarantees of success.
