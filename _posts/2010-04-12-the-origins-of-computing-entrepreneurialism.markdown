title: The Origins of Computing Entrepreneurialism

Recently <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9174661/Altair_8800_inventor_Ed_Roberts_dies_at_68">Computerworld</a>, the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304871704575159680960424558.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_tech">Wall Street Journal</a>, and others reported on the passing of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Roberts_(computer_engineer)">Ed Roberts</a>, founder of MITS and creator of the Altair 8800.  While you may never have heard of him, he represents the point in history where personal computing made a transition from personal hobby to entrepreneurial activity.  MITS was started in Albuquerque in 1971, and sold electronics kits to model rocketry hobbyists, and kits to build <img title="The Origins of Computing Entrepreneurship " src="http://developers.outright.com/files/2010/04/1206266_system.jpg" alt="The Origins of Computing Entrepreneurship " hspace="10" width="300" height="224" align="right" />calculators.

However, calculators became a consumer tool in the early 1970s, and that business largely dried up, so Roberts turned to a computer kit, the Altair 8800, which ran on an 8-bit Intel 8080 processor.  This kit was a smashing success, but Roberts sold it at about cost, not making very much money in the process.  After the launch in Popular Electronics magazine in January 1975, Harvard student Bill Gates and his engineer friend Paul Allen proposed to develop a version of the BASIC programming language that would run on the computer.  Roberts hired them, and eventually they formed their own company, Microsoft, to continue working on it.  The Altair 8800 and MITS were eventually sold to a disk drive manufacturer, and Roberts bought a farm in Georgia, went to medical school, and was a country doctor for the last 20 years of his life.

Computers and software became a real business at this time, rather than a hobby for the electronically inclined.  Gates and Allen went on to make Microsoft the leading software company it is today.  Not too far in the future, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak built the first Apple computer in a garage in Palo Alto, California.  But this was also the dawn of the personal computing revolution.  Up until that time, computers were large and expensive, and were typically used by hundreds of people at the same time using time-sharing principles.  The concept of the personal computer was so radical that DEC founder <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Olsen">Ken Olsen</a> claimed that he saw no need to ever have one in his home.  History has proven that attitude wrong, and the likes of Roberts, Gates, Allen, Steve Jobs, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Kildall">Gary Kildall</a> unabashedly right.

For a prospective entrepreneur, there is a lot to be learned by looking at this very active time in the history of technology.  The bet by a few youngsters on the personal computer, technically inadequate as it was, became the multi-billion dollar set of industries we have today.  It is possible to change the world, but it does require a vision, hard work, and an unshakable belief.  It also helps to be hungry or desperate.  At MITS, Roberts was in financial trouble when he decided to build a personal computer.  The calculator market was being undercut by the likes of HP and Texas Instruments, and the company was losing money quickly.

While being desperate is no precursor to innovation and success, it does make you try things you might not otherwise.  Perhaps most important, there is inspiration in the stories of Roberts and the others of his day.  While they didn’t know it at the time, they created an entirely new industry, and with it a new way of working for everyone.  The thought that we might be doing that as entrepreneurs should be a heady motivation to maintain our efforts.
