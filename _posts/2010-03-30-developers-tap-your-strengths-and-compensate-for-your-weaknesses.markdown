title: Developers, Tap Your Strengths and Compensate for Your Weaknesses
---
I’m <a href="http://pvarho.wordpress.com/about/">Peter Varhol</a>, and I’ve had a long career that includes military service, commercial software development, university teaching, software product management, technology journalism, and now technology business owner.  My company, Technology Strategy Research, is a sole proprietorship that provides software development, systems analysis, consulting, technical marketing, and documentation services.  I hope to share the things I’ve learned about starting and running a small technology business.

There are many reasons today why someone might want to hang out their own shingle and be their own boss.  In my case, I ran the business as a moonlighting operation for many years until a job loss last year.  Rather than seek a role with another employer, I decided that the timing was right for me to make it a full time endeavor.

The first thing you have to determine is your strengths and weaknesses, as both a worker and a business owner.  For example, many coders may be more comfortable in front of a computer than a roomful of people, yet your ability to build a business is directly related to your ability to convince strangers that they need your services.  Or you may be comfortable with human interaction, but not with billing, bookkeeping, and other seemingly mundane activities that are essential to running any successful business.

You can build a business from your strengths, but you have to compensate for your weaknesses.  As much as you might think your value is in understanding and solving technical problems, and nothing else is important, but without good interaction or administrative skills, your business will almost certainly fail.

One option is to hire a part time office administrator and bookkeeper.  This person can invoice clients, cash checks, keep your accounts accurate, purchase supplies, and those types of activities.  You may choose to use a family member or friend in that role, or look for a student at a local <a href="http://www.aacc.nche.edu/Pages/default.aspx">community college</a>.

If you don’t already have clients, it can be helpful to have someone to perform some of the sales roles, such as identifying and contacting leads, explaining services or product features, and closing deals.  I personally am pretty good at explaining to my clients, but I have no inclination to either make the initial contact, or negotiate a price, so I try to use others for these activities or otherwise compensate.

Perhaps you can perform all of the roles you need initially to make your business successful.  If so, more power to you.  But you have to know your limitations, and how to get around them to make all aspects of your business a success.
