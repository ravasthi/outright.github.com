title: Developers, Keep it Simple (Here's Why)
---
A good portion of us have probably spent at least some of our working lives in larger corporations and other organizations.  While most of my time has been spent in smaller companies, I still have years of service at larger entities – the US Air Force, a university, and a major software tools vendor.

Most of us are aware that larger organizations are more complex.  There is some justification to that, because large organization working on big projects typically require infrastructure for communications and coordination.  That infrastructure is a necessary evil; after all, thirty-five years ago software engineer Fred Brooks noted that, due at least in part to communications complexity, adding people to a software project that is already late will make it later.

The larger and more complex structure rarely if ever enables people to accomplish more work; rather, it coordinates and communicates between people working on large or diverse projects.

An example he gives is AT&amp;T considering the Web hosting business in the mid-1990s.  The company concluded that it would not become a Web hosting company, even though it had the prerequisite infrastructure and skills, because the quality imperative imposed upon the corporate culture by the phone business would not let it consider such a low-cost, low-quality business model.

Shirky is talking specifically about media organizations attempting to adapt to new media business endeavors driven by the Internet, but his words can apply to any business.  <strong>If you let your business model get too complex, you can’t chase new business, because you can’t afford to, and you don’t know how to.</strong>

Shirky’s is a cautionary observation, without a proposed cure.  He offers no opinion on how a complex organization might simplify in response to changing business conditions that require more basic approaches.

In contrast, the founders of Internet tools company <a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a>, David Heinemeier Hansson and Jason Fried, espouse a <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/235687">lean and simple structure</a>, with no meetings and a very small staff for what they do.  Yet the company produces innovative products and is by all accounts very profitable.

Large and complex companies have their purpose, but they are exceedingly difficult to steer through changing business conditions.  There are some notable successes, such as IBM and Oracle, that are able to continue to (slowly, gradually) grow a business, not by remaking themselves, but by continuing to win large and complex contracts and projects.  Shirky might argue that the potential for collapse remains in cases like this; it just hasn’t happened yet.

Yet if the technology world is redefined yet again to introduce low-cost products or services, or other types of business that goes against the cultural grain of large and established companies, it will likely open up significant opportunities for smaller companies that are less culturally set in their ways, and more agile.

Are we on the cusp of just such a redefining?  Certainly no one knows, and no one can guess just what it might be.  But we have to be prepared for it to occur, because it can mean the success or failure of our business.

Possessing a vision for your company, and pursing that vision daily, is a tough job.  Sometimes it’s easier and less stressful to let the complexity grow as the company does.  But to focus on the essentials and make sure that you have the company that you want, rather than the one that your growth or markets seem to encourage you toward, is a good start in making sure that you’re ready for the Next Big Thing.
