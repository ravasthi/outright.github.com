title: The Developers' Guide to Setting Up Your Business

Once you’ve made the decision to start your own software development or consulting firm, you have to look into the options of setting up a business.  A caution – I’m not a lawyer, and I’m not providing legal advice.  But these are things you need to be thinking about, and you should research them on your own, or go to an expert.

One option for your business is to do nothing special; you can accept work and get paid as a 1099 worker – that designates the IRS form on which any payments to you are recorded.

<img title="The Developers' Guide to Setting Up Your Business" src="http://developers.outright.com/files/2010/03/1266570_abstract_1.jpg" alt="The Developers' Guide to Setting Up Your Business" hspace="10" width="300" height="225" align="right" />For your annual taxes, you simply file a <a href="http://outright.com/taxes/forms/schedule_c">Schedule C – Profit or Loss From a Business</a>.  Any good <a href="http://turbotax.intuit.com/">tax</a> <a href="http://www.hrblock.com/">software</a> can walk you through it, or it’s easy enough to do entirely by hand.  The profit from your business translates directly into income for you.

And don’t forget to file your quarterly estimate taxes – you have to estimate your tax liability and pay what you believe you owe in income and payroll taxes on April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15.  Not doing so, or underestimating what you owe, will result in penalties.  And you owe not only income taxes, but also both the employer and employee share of payroll (Social Security and Medicare) taxes.

I chose to set up as a <a href="http://education.outright.com/business-formation/legal-protection-tax-savings-incorporate-or-form-an-llc/">limited liability company</a> – an LLC.  The LLC offers me a couple of advantages over simply using your own name.  First, as the name implies, there is a certain legal protection for you as an individual to incorporate in this manner.  Second, I use the corporation name as my brand; it’s how I’m known.

You can also create a C corporation, as most large enterprises are, or a <a href="http://education.outright.com/business-formation/s-corp/">Subchapter S corporation</a>.  There are also a few other, lesser-used options.  Unless you have multiple partners and plan on issuing stock, an LLC might be the best alternative.

Further, if you’re a sole proprietorship and don’t plan on hiring permanent employees, the IRS advises not to apply for an <a href="http://education.outright.com/taxes/forms/the-3ws-who-what-and-why-of-w-9s/">employer ID number</a>.

However you choose to set up the business, you may sooner or later confront the question of employees.  You can work with employees in one of two ways – as independent contractors, or as statutory employees.  The former is the easier way, because you don’t have to worry about employee payroll taxes or other details of actually hiring someone.  You issue these types of workers a <a href="http://education.outright.com/taxes/forms/common-1099-mistakes-%E2%80%93-frequently-asked-questions/">1099</a>, and they are responsible for their own taxes.

If you hire statutory employees, you almost certainly need professional assistance.  You have to be concerned about income and <a href="http://community.outright.com/answers/how-do-you-manage-payroll-for-your-employees-637">payroll</a> taxes, including unemployment taxes, and various types of workplace and other regulations.  You would almost certainly be better off outsourcing your HR needs to a professional.

All of these details beg the question of whether you need a lawyer to help you get set up.  As with most things in life, the answer is a definite maybe.  I didn’t use a lawyer, but I did engage professional help.  There are services available on the Web for setting up various types of businesses.  If your situation is complex, you should use a lawyer, but to get started I simply engaged a service called <a href="http://www.bizfilings.com/">BizFilings.com</a>.  BizFilings took the name and type of business of the company I wanted to start, other information about myself, and came back a few weeks later with an approved name and the state registration paperwork.

One last point – once you have your incorporation paperwork, take it to your bank and set up a <a href="http://education.outright.com/banking/the-right-business-checking-account/">business checking account</a>.  Also obtain a <a href="http://community.outright.com/answers/are-small-businesses-still-getting-hosed-on-credit-cards-are-you-261">business credit card</a>.  Keep your business funds separate from your personal funds; that helps in determining which of your expenses are for business, and which are personal.

In other words, you have to think about a lot before you even start working for your own business.  It’s not a lot of work, but getting them straight first can save a lot more work in the future.
