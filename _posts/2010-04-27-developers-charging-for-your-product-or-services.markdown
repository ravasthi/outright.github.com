title: "Developers: Charging for Your Product or Services"
---
As software developers and small business owners, one of the most difficult things for many of us to do is to figure out how and what to charge for what we do.  It has gotten especially challenging for software developers in recent years, when open source software has been all the rage.  An increasing number of coders have taken to writing some pretty good software that people and organizations are using to run their lives or their businesses and giving it away for free.

The problem is that many of these coders have day jobs, or have other sources of income, or are students, or are being funded to create an open source product for a current or prospective future company.  In most cases, they have income, or are developing an open source product as a way to get noticed for a future job.  How does a regular old developer compete with that?

If you develop custom code, in many cases you are competing not only with similar companies or consultants in your own area, but also competent coders worldwide.  Several web sites let any developer bid for jobs that companies are willing to post.  And because dozens or even hundreds of developers may be bidding on any given job, no matter how low you bid, it is likely that someone, somewhere in the world, will bid lower. That's just basic economics.

Perhaps you provide a unique service or product feature that’s in demand, and can charge on the basis of that added value.  This could be anything from a foreign language skill to experience working with rarely-used software or hardware.  In some cases, that lets you charge a premium for your product or service, but if the skill is truly in demand, others will learn it and bring the price down.

One thing that you can offer is a known quantity; you may be working with clients with whom you have already established a relationship.  Such clients may be willing to pay you because they know you, your work ethic, and your quality of work. 

That’s a more difficult sell with prospective new clients.  In some cases, they may be satisfied in getting to meet you, and being able to associate a face with your work product.  That’s where your <a href="http://developers.outright.com/development/developers-develop-your-people-skills/">people skills</a> come in; you have to project confidence and likability to those you expect to do business with.  Being responsive and fast can also count for a lot, although don’t promise something that you can’t deliver.

It’s best to price your product or service in line with what others are doing.  If you have a product, I highly recommend reading the free e-book <em>Don’t Just Roll the Dice – A Usefully Short Guide to Software Pricing</em> by Neil Davidson (I review it and provide a link <a href="http://pvarhol.wordpress.com/2010/01/03/a-sixty-minute-guide-to-software-pricing/">here</a>).  If you’re offering a service, look to see the going rate for both full-time and contract gigs with similar skills.  You can get such information at sites such as <a href="http://www.salary.com/">Salary.com</a> or the <a href="http://www.dice.com/">Dice</a> board.  Don’t count on getting rates substantially higher unless you have a captive client or unique skills.

In all likelihood you’re not going to become wealthy with your own software company (it certainly is possible, but the vast majority of us don’t).  But technology skills and products remain in demand, and there is enough work to go around to keep all of us busy.
