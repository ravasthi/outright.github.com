title: Developers, Have All New Clients Sign an Agreement
---
Here's a tip that every new web development company would be wise to follow:  <strong>set expectations and</strong> <strong>put everything in writing. </strong>It seems like a no-brainer, but I've seen a lot of young companies get burned because they failed to do so. And the resulting damage is either financial or to the company's reputation. Either type can be crippling for a new company trying to find its way in this highly-competitive industry.

Whatever you're company does that involves money and/or services, make sure there's a clear paper trail signed by both sides before any of the work has started.

For new companies who are dealing with lower dollar amount projects with clients (let's say under $2,500) make sure that the contract isn't overwhelming. Keep it to a page and don't let it get overrun with too much legal mumbo jumbo. The litmus test is that if you can't understand it the first time you read it, then your client won't either.

If your agreement is too complex, there are a couple of things that can happen. First, you'll scare off clients. People spending less than a few thousand dollars don't want to feel like they are signing their life away. Second, you run the risk that your client will use a lawyer. Then you'll have to spend extra money having your lawyer review the client's changes. Ugh. You want to have an agreement that can be used for all of your clients.

Why do you need an agreement? Here are three really good reasons:
<ol>
	<li>An agreement establishes legitimacy. You'll send the message to your client that you run a real company and take your work seriously. That's comforting to clients.</li>
	<li>Clients <em>always </em>change their minds. I've done hundreds of projects over the last 6+ years in this industry. And in each one the client has changed their mind about something. If you don't have them committed via an agreement, they will run all over you. That means you'll lose money. You don't want to do that.</li>
	<li>If something goes bad, you are covered. For example, if your client refuses to pay a signed agreement means that you have it in writing they they are obligated to pay you for your services. Without that signature, you have no chance to get that money if you decide to pursue it via small claims court.</li>
</ol>
Here's a checklist of things you have to agree on with your clients before you get started on a project:
<ul>
	<li>When do you get paid? Do you get some money up front (you better!) with another payment when the project is finished? You have to spell this out specifically. Agree on the payment dates and the exact dollar amount of the payments. And, let the client know that there will be a penalty for late payment. Penalties can range from interest on the unpaid amount (maybe a couple of percent per month) or you can tell them that their website won't be launched until final payment has been received.</li>
	<li>What <em>exactly </em>does the website entail in terms of requirements? How many pages are you going to build, for example? Is the website a static site, or is it powered by a content management system? Are there any forms? Flash? Detail this as much as you can. Be clear about what is included and not included.</li>
	<li>Who is responsible for writing the content? Your company or the client?</li>
	<li>Where will the images for the website come from? Will the client provide them? Are you going to use a stock photo website? If so, are the fees for buying those images including in the cost of the website?</li>
	<li>Where will the website be hosted?</li>
	<li>What happens if the client changes the requirements for the website? At what rate will you do additional work? For example, let's say in the middle of the project the client decides to add a Wordpress blog to their site. You need to get paid to install Wordpress.</li>
	<li>How will the website be maintained once it's launched? Are you on the hook for any changes?</li>
	<li>What happens if the website has any bugs? Are you obligated it fix errors?</li>
</ul>
For those of you running a small development shop or you're in a position where you just can't afford a lawyer  yet, that's okay. Create an agreement of your own. I  created one and used it for the first few years I ran my company. Use plain  language that basically says, "Client will pay my company $x on such and  such a date in exchange for the following services." Tell them exactly  what you will and won't do so there's no gray area.

As your company grows and the dollar amounts of your projects get higher so too does the risk involved. In this case consider using a lawyer to create more customized agreements. The good news is that clients in these situations will most likely be expecting an agreement to be signed. It's par for the course.

If you're just getting started in this fun and profitable industry just remember that you can do everything right but that might not be enough. You can run your business above board and be the most moral business person ever. That doesn't mean you'll be immune from some kind of dispute. Whether it's a customer refusing to pay or a freelancer slacking off on before their deadline, you'll need to throw down the hammer from time-to-time and protect whats yours. And if you've put everything in writing and had both sides sign you'll be much happier for it.

For a new web developer with his or her first contract, getting the client to sign an agreement is often the last thing they think about.
