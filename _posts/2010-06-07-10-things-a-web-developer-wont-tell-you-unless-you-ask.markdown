title: 10 Things a Web Developer Won't Tell You (Unless You Ask)
---
Web development is an awesome business. Yeah, there's tons of competition - more than you can imagine - but there's always plenty of work for developers who treat clients properly and do good work that provides value for clients.

These days, in particular, there's a lot of business to go around. Lately I've been talking to a lot of first-time entreprenuers who want to build their very first website. I can appreciate what they are going through. They're trying to find the best provider possible for their budget. It can be challenging given all of the choices out there.

I put together the following list to help first timers, and even people looking to re-launch a current website, of things to watch out for when they talk to potential <a href="http://www.jestercreative.com/how-to-choose-a-web-design-company/">website developers</a> (I use the term "developer" to mean any person or company that designs and builds websites). There's so much you need to know about potential partner beyond just what they've worked on in the past and their hourly rate. The key is to treat your search like an interview process. The more you can find out, the easier it will be to make the decision on whom to pay your hard-earned money.

Here are 10 things a web developer won't tell you unless you ask:

<strong>1. I'm a developer, not a business owner.</strong>

<strong> </strong>
All too many web developers don't keep in mind the big picture - delivering ROI for their clients. Instead, they see new business as purely a chance to crank out a website as fast as possibly so they can get paid. I know this because capitalizing on <a href="http://www.impactmedia.co.uk/blog/pay-per-click-ppc/improving-your-websites-roi-with-ppc-advertising-716/">website ROI</a> is the way my website development firm has won a lot of its business. People like the fact that we try to make sure our clients make their money back and a whole lot more. We try to help clients think months, and even years, ahead so that their website is always providing a valuable platform for them to sell their goods or services.

<strong><em>Lesson:</em></strong> Make sure the website developer you hire firmly grasps how your new or revised website fits into your companies goals and plans to be successful. Avoid becoming just another link on someone's portfolio.

I like impressing my peers more than my clients.</strong>

<strong> </strong>
Some developers develop for competition rather than providing a service. They look forward to the day they can send out a link to their new project to their buddies rather than aiming to put a smile on their client's face. Being <a href="http://www.dlwhitesite.com/2760/trendy-seo-tools-metrics-and-the-latest-craze/">cool or trendy</a> is more important to them than delivering a website that actually helps their client sell their products or services. Not only is this disappointing to the client, it's dangerous. Sites that are built to impress because they have a cool design or feature often minimize the importance of user-experience and conversion efficiency. As a result, the client is left with a pretty looking site that confuses, or worse, frustrates users. And that doesn't lead to sales.

<strong><em>Lesson: </em></strong>Hire a developer that is going to listen to your needs and use best practice techniques for converting traffic into business. Ask them flat out why they develop websites. Really listen to their answers. It will tell you a lot about the person's motivation.

<strong>3. I use new, unproven technologies.</strong>

A lot of people won't think to ask what technology their website will be built in. The reason this is a good thing to find out is because some technologies are fleeting. From time-to-time, new programming languages come out. And there's big hype by their creators to get developers to build applications using that language so it can become more popular. Some developers get swayed by the hype and build something in that new language. It works great until the group that created the language either sells it to a larger company that won't support it going forward, or more commonly, the founders move on to another project and abandon the language. That means there's no support, so anything developed is now left to exist on its own. That leaves you with something built in a technology that barely anyone knows how to use anymore (because developers have once again moved on to the next big thing) and no one supports.

<strong><em>Lesson:</em></strong> Ask your developer what technology they are going to use to build your website or application and WHY. Ask how long that language has been around and for how long they have programmed in that language. Ask them for examples of other work they've done in that language so you can get a sense for how well it works.

<strong>4. I hope you don't bring up SEO.</strong>

<strong> </strong>
This is a really big one. For whatever reason, most consumers falsely assume that the act of launching any web presence will automatically place them in the good graces of the search engines and big traffic will start rolling in. That's wrong for more reasons than I could write in a single blog post. The other harmful part to this is the assumption that <em>at least</em> a website at launch will be optimized for search - or at least it won't contain anything that will actually hurt its search presence. That's a costly assumption.

The combination of developing a valuable website and fulfillment all of the basic SEO fundamentals is not exactly common. Most times those two things are mutually exclusive.

<strong><em>Lesson:</em></strong> Unfortunately, too many people expect great things from their website from the day it launches. If no one ever brings up SEO, then nothing is being done. Make sure you know exactly what is being done SEO-wise as part of your project.

<strong>5. I don't actually do the work...neither does anyone else in this country.</strong>

<strong> </strong>
There's nothing wrong with <a href="http://blueleafgraphics.com/reasons-to-outsource-your-seo-web-design-projects.html">outsourcing web development</a>. It's common practice these days and it should make you're investment into building a website cheaper because labor costs will be lower.

<em><strong>Lesson:</strong></em> Make sure you know who will actually be doing the work. Is it the person you are talking to? Or is it something in their office? Or someone in India? If they have used this method in the past and you think they do good work, then that's probably nothing to worry about. But if you have any objections or suspicions about how outsourcing your work could affect the project, then you have to consider if this vendor is right for you.

<strong>6. You're website design is the same as 1,000 others.</strong>

<strong> </strong>
In other words, what you are actually paying for is a website template. For some people this is a non-issue. For example, those that are are budget-constrained are fine with selecting something from a catalog of designs. Others despise the idea of one day stumbling on another site that looks exactly the same as theirs does. Some developers will make it look like everything they do is custom, but in reality they are just reselling templates.

<em><strong>Lesson:</strong></em> Not every website is custom designed. Make sure you ask if your website will be built from scratch or from a template. More importantly, make sure you're not paying for custom work when you are getting a template in return.

<strong>7. Every project goes over budget - and that's not my fault.</strong>

<strong>
</strong>Some developers are better at managing their time than others. The ones that struggle finishing projects on time usually make it a habit. In other words, they are always late. What you need to be careful of are the developers that are late and then find a way to make you pay extra for it. Also, what does it say about that provider if they don't stick to timelines? Do you really want to work with someone like that?

<strong><em>Lesson: </em></strong>Ask to talk to past clients. Find out from them how well your developers delivered on their timeline (and on everything else for that matter). Make sure that your project is high enough priority that you can count on it getting done when it's supposed to be.

<strong>8. My plate is completely full.</strong>

<strong> </strong>
Some developers are complete superstars. They can work on 10 things at once and deliver all of them on time.  Others just don't have the resources to do more than a few things at a time. A small portion of developers will try to pad their accounts receivables with no intention of completing on your timeline. They just want to get your deposit and figure out the timing later.

<em><strong>Lesson: </strong></em>Find out what else your developer is working on and how your project is affecting their overall bandwidth. Ask them questions like: Have they ever worked on this many projects before? How did it affect delivery? Trust your gut instinct on whether or not you think they can deliver based on what else they have to do. If you really like the developer but think they have too much on their plate, schedule your project for when some time frees up.

<strong>9. This is my second job.</strong>

<strong> </strong>
Related to the above: find out how much of a priority developing websites is for this developer. Preferably, it will be their full time gig. Some developers build websites on the side for extra income. That's fine. The point is that you should know how much of a priority your project is. Moreover, what are their long term plans? Does this provider have any intention in being there for you in a year or two years when you want to work with them again?

<strong>Lesson: </strong>Get as much info as you can about your developers modus operandi. If he or she only works at night and weekends, that's fine. At least you'll know and won't get worried when they don't return your calls during the day time.

<strong>10. Making changes to your website will be painful.</strong>

<strong> </strong>
This means you won't have control over your own content. Any time you want to change existing content or add something new, it will have to be done on your developers schedule. Convenience of changing anything on your website is crucial. You don't want it to take days or longer to post something really important for your users.

<em><strong>Lesson:</strong></em> When at all possible, make sure a content management system is included in the scope of work. Give yourself the ability to make changes to your site. You may opt not to use that option, but at least your site won't be 100% dependent on someone else to be fresh.
