title: "Rails and Agile: Musings of a Fresh Convert"
---
I'm a typical backend hacker.  I like algorithms, machine learning, databases, processing pipelines, and building systems to work with really cool data.  I've used C++, Java, Python, and Perl, and never touched a web framework before.  I've worked mostly alone, interfacing with other code through databases and APIs.  Then I joined Outright.com.

Outright is an agile rails shop.  <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on rails</a> is a very impressive environment.  There are so many smart features to make development faster and easier: my current favorites are <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html">ActiveRecord</a>, which turns <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> schemas into seamless in-memory objects, and ActiveTest with Mocha, to easily test mock objects and external APIs.  Rails supports the agile process with separate development, testing, and production databases built in.  A single command can boot the entire app on localhost with Mongrel or load all the code into memory in an interactive terminal.  The Autotest gem runs all the right unit tests after each save.  I could go on and on...

Agile is about visibility: project goals and current status are visible to everyone all the time.  To paraphrase <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_48/b3961001.htm">Peter Drucker</a>, if obstacles are visible, they will be addressed.  Quick <a href="http://agilesoftwaredevelopment.com/blog/peterstev/how-hold-daily-scrum">daily scrums</a> reveal issues as they're budding, before they become somebody's fault.  The team decides together what it can accomplish and is responsible for delivering.  It's just more fun to set and achieve your own goals, and that's part of agile's success.

I have a ton to learn about rails and agile, but I've become a convert.
