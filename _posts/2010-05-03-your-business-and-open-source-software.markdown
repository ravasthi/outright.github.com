title: Your Business and Open Source Software
---
As you’re probably aware, open source software has gained significant popularity in recent years.  Company IT departments like open source tools for many support functions, and individual users make use of freely available Web applications for many activities.

There are two ways of utilizing open source in your business.  The first is to write your own open source or free application, and the second is to use already-existing free and open source (often abbreviated FOSS) software in your own business practices.

A surprising number of developers engage in developing open source software as an entry by which to start a company.  Likewise, many well-known tech companies offer users a free service, such as Twitter and Facebook, and hope to make money while keeping that service free.

<img title="Your Business and Open Source Software" src="http://developers.outright.com/files/2010/05/1170088_open_window.jpg" alt="Your Business and Open Source Software" hspace="10" width="300" height="200" align="right" />There are advantages to free and open source software as a business strategy.  Other developers and end users are more willing to try your software if they know it’s free of charge.  It can create a buzz around your software and company with little or no marketing or sales spending.  If successful, it’s possible to grow your company quickly and inexpensively.

But like all businesses, sooner or later you have to make money at it (otherwise it becomes <a href="http://education.outright.com/taxes/business-or-hobby/">a hobby, not a business</a>, which the IRS treats very differently for tax purposes).  And for a business that begins on an open source or free use basis, that’s a difficult transition to make.

The first reason is that you are likely to get pushback from your users, who have become accustomed to using your software for free.  Many have discovered that making users pay for something that had been free often results in far fewer users.  The second reason is that the expectations may have been raised so much by a large user base that it could be impossible to generate enough income to justify the investment.

How you might make money off of a business that didn’t start off collecting money depends on the nature of the business.  If you have a popular Web-based service, you may be able to sell advertising or sponsorships to those who might like to reach your audience.

If you’re giving away a free software product, there are a couple of different options.  You can continue to give away the product, but charge to provide support.  This is the approached originally pioneered by leading Linux vendor Red Hat Software.  Alternatively, you can designate a freely available base product, but charge for enhanced versions.

As with most things in life and business, free software is a two-edge sword.  It can help you market your business, but it is a hindrance toward making money off that business.  The trick is to turn recognition, popularity, utility, and approval into revenue.  To do that, in general, you have to add value beyond what you are providing for free, and at least some users must be willing to pay for that value.  If you think in those terms, you may be able to come up with other possibilities to turn your free software into a paying business.

But whatever you do, don’t think that you can start charging for something that you’ve offered for free in the past.  That genie is out of the bottle, and unless they can’t do without your offering, your users will simply stop using it.  Instead, look at one or more of the collateral ways of making money.

Depending on the nature of your business and the macro economic conditions, there is one last possibility.  If your software or Web business is popular, but not making money, it is sometimes possible to sell it to a more established commercial concern.  It then becomes the problem of that company to figure out how to make money on your software.

<strong>Using Open Source Software in Your Business Practice</strong>

The other business alternative is to use open source software as an integral part of your business practice.  For example, I do occasional work for an IT consulting firm that focuses on Web application development using open source Web servers, frameworks, and operating systems.  It’s fairly common for especially smaller consulting shops to use open source software extensively, because most open source code is often (though not always) free of charge.  Without the need to pay licensing fees, developers and their clients can deploy Web applications without regard to additional costs for those licenses.

The open source software movement was begun and promoted by Richard Stallman back in the 1980s.  While many of his ideas would be considered radical even by today’s standards, the concept of open source software has gone decidedly mainstream.  Tens of thousands of developers worldwide collaborate on thousands of projects that are free for modification and use.  And many more use that software to provide consulting services or conduct their day to day business.

Open source software does have licensing requirements, although they aren’t the same as commercial licenses, and they don’t require that money changes hands.  There are more than sixty different types of recognized open source licenses, and many others that purport to be open source but have one or more flaws.  You can <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">examine the different open source licenses here</a>.

It’s very important for you to understand and comply with the applicable licenses for any open source software you use.  In general, an open source license requires the source code covered by the license to be provided along a copy of the license itself.  If you make any modifications to that open source code, those modifications

If you’re a consultant or software developer using code licensed in this manner, that means that you have to provide both source code and a copy of the license for any code that you’ve used that is open source.  If it’s for a client, you have to give the client a copy of the open source software (though not necessarily software that you’ve written along with it).

A few licenses, such as Stallman’s own <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>, require that any code using it also be open source (although there are technical distinctions here that even lawyers disagree on).  For that reason, code licensed with this or a similar license is rarely used by consultants and end users in their own solutions.

If you modify the open source code, the process becomes trickier.  Your changes have to be covered by that same open source license, and you must make your changes available to the open source community at large.  For this reason, few consultants attempt to modify open source code directly.  For most licenses, you can programmatically call open source code without having all of your own code declared as open source.

I’m not a lawyer, but I can say from experience that few lawyers know their way around open source software.  Just about any lawyer will tell you not to use it at all, simply because the potential for using it incorrectly represents a risk, so most legal advice you get won’t be helpful.  Instead, if you are going to use open source software in your projects, read the license yourself; you are in the best position to determine if you are in compliance.

Still, the legal ramifications shouldn’t deter you from leveraging open source software for your products or services.  But there are pitfalls, and you need to understand how to use this software to make sure you don’t fall into one of them.
