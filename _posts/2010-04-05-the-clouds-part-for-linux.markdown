title: The Clouds Part for Linux
---
There are likely those among you who are fans of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> operating system.  Because it is open source and can be acquired freely (some also sell Linux, but are still required to provide the source code), it doesn’t matter how many users access a Linux server because there are no client license fees.  Techies also tend to favor its configurability and large network of both skills and software tools.

But there has been a cloud hanging over Linux for the last several years.  It’s a complicated story, so bear with me.  Linux is a more-or-less functional equivalent of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_V">Unix</a> operating system, developed by AT&amp;T Bell Labs in the 1970s.

Switching back over to Linux, among a variety of companies started to commercialize it was Caldera.  Caldera ultimately didn’t come out on top as a Linux provider, so it acquired SCO and with it the Unix business, and renamed itself The SCO Group.

Now, Unix is proprietary, while Linux is open source, written by volunteers with no expectation of profit.  But to achieve functional equivalence of Unix, many of the Linux source code files are in fact similar to those of Unix.  This is especially true of the C language header files, which define types and variables.

The SCO Group noted possible similarities between Unix and Linux files, and filed suit against IBM, one of the largest Linux providers and promoters.  It also threatened to sue enterprises that used Linux on the grounds of copyright infringement, and extracted license payments from several enterprises that were concerned about litigation surrounding their mission-critical business systems.

But wait!  Novell then sued SCO, claiming that while it sold the original SCO the Unix business, it retained the copyrights to the source files.  That litigation has been going on since 2004 in various courts, and I won’t get into the details.

Despite the length of this post, I have greatly simplified most of the details of this soap opera.  However, on March 30<sup>th</sup>, a jury in Utah <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9174466/Jury_sides_with_Novell_in_long_running_SCO_battle">ruled that Novell in fact still owned the copyrights to Unix</a>.  This doesn’t end the litigation, because there are appeals and other judgments yet to be made, but at long last the end may be in sight.  If you want to read more about it, <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20100330152829622">here</a> is a good source.

For businesses using Linux, programming for Linux, or recommending Linux to business clients, it seems like it’s once again a safe bet.  After the jury has determined ownership of the copyrights, there seems little chance that there can be enforcement of a copyright license on Linux users.
