<img align="right" style="margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 0px" src="http://developers.outright.com/files/2010/03/the_beatles_rock_band_box_art.jpg" alt="the_beatles_rock_band_box_art" width="148" height="183" />Stopped back by the office to help with the evening deployment of our <a href="http://stores.outright.com/bookkeeping/automatically-record-archive-and-prepare-your-ebay-business-for-taxes/">eBay import</a> the other night, and the deployment wasn't working at all.  We troubleshot it down to an issue connecting to <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, an open source collaboration we use for code control, probably because of a maintenance activity they were working on.  Bernd, who is developing closely with eBay and PayPal here, said he'd keep trying later in the evening, and I figured "my work here is done".

But then I saw the box for Beatles Rock Band just sitting there mocking me for going unopened the last week.  I looked around, and while there were a couple lights on, absolutely nobody else was in the office.  So I grabbed a mic and tried a couple songs.

Two hours later, I'm still at it.  I stop back my my computer, and Bernd is asking if I'm still around.  GitHub was happy again, but there was some other issue.  40 minutes later, all fixed and the updates went out on schedule.  Sweet.

Outright loves you, Beatles Rock Band.  My wife... ahem.
