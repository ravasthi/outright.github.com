title: Local Coffee Shops Serve Fresh Focus Groups

So the other day we were working on a new feature.  We like to build "just enough", which is to say "build less" of a feature, so that we can get it out into the wild and get feedback from users.  We thought, "why build code to test when we can could just talk to users?"  So we did: our interaction designer threw together some mockups and we took 'em on the road.  Down to our <a href="http://www.orchardvalleycoffee.com/">local coffee shops</a>, that is.

While we were there, we encountered fully half of our company's staff, one and two at a time, and Bill happened to take this stealth photo of our interview with <a href="http://www.gorillacube.com/">Gorilla Cube</a> cofounder Brian Correia.

It's great fun hearing what real people need from their bookkeeping software.  Surprising sometime, but fun!

So you're wondering what feature we were working on?  Ssshhh... it's a secret, and we still have a mile to go before we unwrap it for you.
