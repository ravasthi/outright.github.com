title: Tech Entrepreneurs, Cheese Doodles are Not the Answer
---
Writing code is a deeply engrossing activity.  It typically requires such single-mined focus and concentration that several hours can go by before you suddenly realize that you haven’t eaten.  If you’re like most coders, at this point you open the pantry door and pull out a bag of Cheese Doodles and munch away while continuing to code.  Or if you discover that the sun has moved most of the way across the sky, a call to the local pizza parlor could be warranted.

You may be on a roll, churning out hundreds of lines of new and elegant code over the course of a day.  Or you may be focused on a bug or other problem, drilling down into the bowels of the code so far that you need to take an oxygen tank with you.  But the code is the most important thing.

<img title="Tech Entrepreneurs, Improve Your Eating Habits" src="http://developers.outright.com/files/2010/05/1266226_green_salad.jpg" alt="Tech Entrepreneurs, Improve Your Eating Habits" hspace="10" width="300" height="199" align="right" />Wrong-o.  Cheese Doodles, pizza, and their ilk (potato chips, Ring Dings, and so on) may be filling to an empty stomach, and they may even contain some of the same ingredients as one or more of the recommended food groups, but they don’t provide you with the ability to be at your best for the long haul.

You may not realize it now, but I guarantee that as your age creeps up past, say, the mid-30s, you will see a significant bulge in your midsection, and an increase in the waist size of your pants.  At worst, the pants size stays the same, they just sit lower on your hips, giving you an uncanny resemblance in profile to a bowling pin.  You’ve seen them and laughed, but you’re gonna be one.

And it’s worse than that.  Your weight is only one consideration.  Cheese Doodles may keep you alive, but not for an otherwise natural lifespan.  Combined with a sedentary profession (that’s a topic for another post), eating junk food will result in poor nutrition, susceptibility to illness and injury, and overall uncertain health.  Don’t even look at your cholesterol numbers.  Snack food won’t kill you tomorrow, but over the course of your working life, it will steadily wear away at your overall health and well-being.

Perhaps the worst thing that a junk food addiction does for you today is lowers your energy level and endurance.  You might think that it’s giving you energy to work longer, but it’s really just a short sugar or calorie burst.  Over time, your staple of Cheese Doodles produces less energy than just about any other food you can be eating.

If you haven’t already, I strongly recommend that you discover the <a href="http://goinggreendc.net/2010/05/03/eating-greener-tips-and-a-recipe-from-aviva-goldfarb/">Green Things</a> section of your local supermarket.  I, for one, find asparagus, artichokes, and broccoli not only edible, but actually tasty (but Brussels sprouts are still pretty awful).  Chances are that you may be surprised at how convenient and filling fresh fruits and vegetables are.  Go ahead, chew on a celery stalk.  No one will see you.

Second, push yourself away from the table.  The computer table, that is.  <a href="http://www.walkingstuff.com/2010/05/exercise-in-green-spaces-can-reduce-mental-stress-2/">Take a walk</a> or <a href="http://www.branchwhipped.com/first-mountain-bike-ride-of-the-season/">bike ride </a>for half an hour; don’t worry, your code will still be there when you get back.

Last, invest in a <a href="http://www.fakefoodfree.com/2010/05/shrimp-taco-dorado-and-cookbook-review.html">cookbook</a> that promises good recipes that can be prepared in only a few minutes.  In the time it takes to reseal the Cheese Doodles bag, you can have something on the table that is both tasty and healthy.

By all means, try something new.  You’ll probably like it, and it will save your life.
